# Sarium

**An engineered network of autonomous agents — composable, auditable, and self-reinforcing.**

Sarium is a Solana-native infrastructure for deploying, coordinating, and verifying autonomous agents on-chain. It is designed as a modular network where agents can compose behaviors, reinforce each other through shared incentives, and operate transparently with verifiable execution.

---

## ✨ Core Principles

* **Autonomous by Design** — Agents operate independently with deterministic logic and defined boundaries.
* **Composable Architecture** — Agents, modules, and strategies can be combined without tight coupling.
* **Auditable & Verifiable** — On-chain execution, transparent state, and traceable agent behavior.
* **Self-Reinforcing Network** — Incentives, feedback loops, and coordination mechanisms strengthen the system over time.
* **Solana-Native** — Built for high throughput, low latency, and parallel execution.

## 🧠 What is Sarium?

Sarium is not a single agent, bot, or application. It is a **network layer** that enables:

* Deployment of autonomous agents on Solana
* Secure interaction between agents
* Shared execution primitives and incentives
* Verifiable outcomes without custodial trust

The result is an evolving system where agents collaborate, compete, and optimize within a common protocol.

---

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

Sarium is structured around several core layers:

* **Agent Layer** — Stateless or stateful autonomous agents with clearly defined roles
* **Coordination Layer** — Messaging, task routing, and agent-to-agent interaction
* **Execution Layer** — Deterministic Solana programs handling actions and settlement
* **Incentive Layer** — Rewards, penalties, and reinforcement mechanisms
* **Audit Layer** — On-chain logs, proofs, and verifiable execution traces

Each layer is designed to be replaceable and extensible.
